 * for implementing "interfaces" or "abstract classes" on the spot
 *
 * Since they have no name, we canâ€™t use them in order to create instances of anonymous classes
 *
 * As a result, we have to declare and instantiate anonymous classes in a single expression at the point of use
 *
 * We may either extend an existing class or implement an interface
